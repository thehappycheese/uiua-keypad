# Uiua Keypad

(unofficial)

The iocn on the left bar should appear when editing editing a file with the `.ua` extention.

You may experience glitches since I was forced to use
`command:workbench.action.previousEditor` to switch focus back to your current
editor every time you click a key. Please raise an issue on the github if you
have trouble and let me know :)
