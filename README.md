The icon on the left bar should appear when editing editing a file with the
`.ua` extension, or you can do `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for `uiua activate keypad`.

## Want to try voice commands instead?

For this extention you have to click glyph buttons with your mouse. Thats hard work!
Check out my video explaining how to use your voice to input Uiua glyphs :smile:

## Known Issues

There are still some weird glitches when clicking glyphs related to setting the
focus back to the active editor. It is much improved from previous versions and
should be usable enough.

Inserting into a jupyter notebook will trigger extra glitches, but there is no
kernel yet so I haven't bothered trying to fix that.

## Thanks
